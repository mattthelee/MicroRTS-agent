• Abstract: 

a summary in a 70-150 words paragraph. Motivate the research and explain your findings.


• Introduction:

initial introduction to the problem, motivation and outline of the rest of the paper.

• microRTS:

Brief description of the game, and literature review of what has been done in research before
in this and similar games.

• Background:

Explain here the algorithm that the submitted agent’s technique is based on, including
literature review.

• Techniques Implemented: 

Explanation and description of the agent submitted, and possible variants. How
do you value a state? Have you used abstract/macro actions in your approach (and how)?


• Experimental Study: 

Describe the experimental study performed to obtain the final submitted agent (i.e.,
the procedure used to obtain the best combination of parameters, effect on the results of adding different
functionality to the agent, empirical comparison against sample bots, etc).

• Analysis: 

Analysis of the development process (What things worked? What things didn’t work? Did
something surprise you?)
• Overall conclusions 

(problems and difficulties found, main takeaways) and potential future work. Note
that conclusions must not be a reflection of what did the assignment mean for you as a student, but a
critical summary of the work and findings of the project.
