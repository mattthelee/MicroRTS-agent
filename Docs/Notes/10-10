Strategy Chooser
	• Easy - Just choose strategy each time
	• Medium - Could keep on the same strategy for multiple strategies
	• Hard - Or pick some inertia which looks at what has previously been chosen


What enemy are we playing against?
	• Some metric of 
	• More than 3 workers and no barracks - WorkerRush
	• Lots of LightRush -> LightRush
	• Lots of HeavyRush -> HeavyRush
	• Lots of RangedRush -> RangedRush
	• Easy version first - Just use if functions to go for the top 4
	• Default to workerRush
	• Medium - Weighting of all those strategies

How do we evaluate the state?
	• The SimpleSqrEvaluation works well
	• Easy is leave as it is
	• Medium is adding in average distance of enemy units to our base
	• Hard is simulating loads of AIs to see which won

Extras bots:
	• Bens bot - Smaller maps
	• Matt's bot - Larger Maps
	• Chaser bot??
	

What maps are being tested on:
	• Probably 4 shown, with 4 hidden
	• Need to test on most maps we currently have
	• No need to test on the 20% special maps
	
Exception
	• Try-Catching
	• Index out of bounds
	

Testing
	• Win percentage
	• Exception reduction
	• Need something to say how does our current AI does in the tournament
	• How do we evaluate in the tournament - just win, or how long does it take?
